Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Heap, Merge, Quick)

# The program will test which algorithm is the best for the scenario below:

  Two different array sizes : 100 and 1000.
  
  Following this random number distributions:
  <ol type="a">
      <li> Completely random </li>
      <li> Almost sorted in ascending order ( about 90% of items are in increasing order, 10% are random) </li>
      <li> Almost reversed -  same as b) but in reverse order</li>
  </ol>
