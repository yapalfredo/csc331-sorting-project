Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Heap, Merge, Quick)

The program will test which algorithm is the best for the scenario below:

  Two different array sizes : 100 and 1000.
  Use the following random number distributions :
    a) Completely random
    b) Almost sorted in ascending order ( about 90% of items are in increasing order, 10% are random)
    c) Almost reversed -  same as b) but in reverse order
